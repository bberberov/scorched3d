## Gameplay

Learning how to play is easy, just point the turret, adjust power and trajectory, select a weapon â€“ and shoot!

Manage your inventory of weapons with the prize money you win during each round of combat. Learn the basic controls using the tutorial mode, or set up your own game by customising dozens of economy and environmental conditions to your liking, or simply play online immediately at one of the various public servers.

You can play with up to twenty-four other players at a time, mixing computer players with humans on both randomly generated landscapes and user-designed maps. Scorched3D comes bundled with Apocalypse mod, which offers enhanced levels of weaponry.
